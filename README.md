## Setting up a Hysteria2 client node on GL-iNet GL-MT3000(Beryl AX) router
___

> [!NOTE]
> I use the [following guide](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/09/13/hysteria2-furious/) on setting up a Hysteria2 server and a client on a desktop PC to test the server is working.

> [!WARNING]
> I'm not responsible if this guide brick your router. If it does happen, you can try using [this guide](https://docs.gl-inet.com/router/en/3/tutorials/debrick/) to restore the firmware for your GL-iNet router.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide should also work for GL-iNet MT2500A/MT6000 and any OpenWrt router using an ARM Cortex-A53 processor with at least 256MB of flash storage. The router will have use up of total ~220MB of flash storage after setting up the Hysteria2 client node.

### Prerequisites
___
1. Make sure you're connected to the router in the same IP address and and able to connect to it e.g. http://192.168.8.1/.
2. Update to the latest firmware for your OpenWrt router. The GL-iNet version of the OpenWrt still stuck version 21 as of writing this guide.
3. Make sure to install LuCI interface in the `Advanced Settings` of the GL-iNet Admin Panel webpage for GL-iNet router or use the `opkg` command after sshing into the router and using `opkg update` command after step 2.

### Installation
___
Step 1. Ssh into your router at 192.168.8.1 as _root_ user with **PuTTY** for Windows or using the built in ssh client in Windows Command Prompt/MacOS Terminal.
Step 2. Run update for OpenWrt packages.

```bash
opkg update
```
> [!NOTE]
>If you haven't install LUCI from the Admin Panel webpage, use the following command to install it.
```bash
opkg install luci-app-opkg
```

Step 3. Run the following command to download and execute a script to update the OpenWrt's LuCI Admin Panel with the custom iStoreOS theme.

```bash
wget -O gl-inet.sh https://cafe.cpolar.top/wkdaily/gl-inet-onescript/raw/branch/master/gl-inet.sh && chmod +x gl-inet.sh && ./gl-inet.sh
```
Step 4. You should see the following Chinese text install menu. Go ahead and press `1` and then `ENTER` key for **GL.iNet GL-MT3000一键iStoreOS风格化`** option.

> [!NOTE]
>This will take couple of minutes for the script to install the iStoreOS theme.

![finish install](https://github.com/nextrizon/Hysteria2/blob/main/install-complete.png)

Press `ENTER` key when seeing above text and then the `q` key to quit out of the script as you don't need to install any of the other modules.

Step 5. Login into the newly installed LuCI iStoreOS theme from the `Advanced Settings` from the GL-iNet Admin Panel webpage or directly at http://192.168.8.1:8080

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the text in this LuCI theme are in Chinese, you can enable Chrome browser's auto Google Translate and see the text in your default language.
> But I will continue this guide showing the original Chinese menu.

Step 6. Manual install PassWall2 plug-in in the iStore app page. Download the latest PassWall2 plug-in from [this GitHub page](https://github.com/AUK9527/Are-u-ok/tree/main/apps)
> [!NOTE]
>There are 5 different iStore plug-ins available for router using ARM Cortex-A53 processor. Download the one for **PassWall2** as I couldn't get Hysteria2 working with OpenClash and I didn't bother with the other plug-ins once I got PassWall2 working.
As writing of this guide I downloaded the plug-in file e.g., **PassWall2_25.5.7_aarch64_a53_all_sdk_22.03.7.run**.

Step 7. Using the above menu screen, select `iStore` on the left side menu, select `手动安装` for Manual Installation, and then select `选择或拖放文件` to upload the PassWall2 .run file to install the plug-in.

Step 8. It's going to take a minute or 2 to install the PassWall2 plug-in, the pop-up screen will have **red** dot when the installation process is running and will turn to a **green** dot when it has finished. Click **green** dot to exit out of the install screen.

Step 9. You need go back to the GL.iNet Admin Panel webpage and select **Reboot** icon in the upper right corner.

> [!WARNING]
> You must reboot the router after installing the PassWall2 plug-in, else the router might not connect to the Hysteria2 server after you have created the Hysteria2 node on this router.

Step 10. Log back into the LuCI Admin panel webpage at http://192.168.8.1:8080 once the router is reboot and make sure it's connected in the same IP address range.

Step 11. Using the above menu screen, select the gear icon `服务` for **Service**, and then select `PassWall 2`. Next select the 2nd tab `节点列表` for the **Node List** and select either of the blue `添加` buttons to **Add To** the Node List.

![Hysteria2 setup](https://github.com/nextrizon/Hysteria2/blob/main/Hy2node.png)

Step 12. Using the above menu screen to create a Hysteria2 node using the settings from the [above guide](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/09/13/hysteria2-furious/) for the Hysteria2 server install.
> [!NOTE]
>The easiest way to do it is to `Export Share Link To Clipboard` from the **[Furious](https://github.com/LorenEteval/Furious/releases)** client in the `Edit Configuration` menu and then import config by selecting the `导入分享URL`/**Importing Share URL** in Passwall2 node list page, if you did a test connection using the [above guide](https://cscot.pages.dev/2023/09/13/hysteria2-furious/).

Enter for the following boxes:

|Chinese|English|What to enter|
|-------|-------|-------------|
|节点备注|Node Remark|Unique name for this node in the node list|
|类型|Type|Change to **Hysteria2**|
|协议名称|Protocal Name|Should default to **UDP**|
|地址（支持域名)|IP Adress(Domain Supported)|Either the IP address or the host and domain name of the Hysteria2 server|
|端口|Port|Enter **443** or whatever port # you decided to use in your Hysteria2 server setup|
|端口跳跃范围|Port Hopping Range|You can leave it blank or enter number range like 1000-2000|
|混淆密码|Obfuscated Password|Leave it blank unless you setup obfucation tag in the server config file|
|认证密码|Authentication Password|Enter the password that was used the server config file|
|域名|Domain Name|You can use the same domain as above|
|快速打开|Allow Insecure Connections|Should **not** check the box as the server is using a secure certificate|
|PinSHA256|PinSHA256|Leave it blank, I think it's needed when the server isn't using secure certificate|
|最大上行(Mbps)|Maximum Uplink(Mbps)|Leave it blank, unless you want to limite the uplink speed|
|最大下行(Mbps)|Maximum Downlink(Mbps)|Again blank, unless otherwise|
### Just leave the rest of the boxes blank

Select blue `保存并应用` button on the bottom of the page to **Save and Apply** the settings that were entered

Step 13. You see the newly created Hysteria2 node under the existing **Xray 分流** node. Click on the `测试` next to the Hysteria2 node to do a **Test** ping to the Hysteria2 server.

Step 14. Select the 1st tab `基本设置` to go back to the **Basic Setting** Menu

Step 15. Change the `节点` Node selection from the default `Xray 分流` node to the newly created `Hysteria2` node.

Step 16. Select the `主开关` **Main Switch** check box to start the Hysteria2 proxy connection when router starts up and select blue `保存并应用` button on the bottom of the page to **Save and Apply** the change.

Step 17. The **Core** status should change from a red `未运行` not running status to a green `运行中` running status.

Step 18. You can test the latency of the Baidu, Google, and Github connections by clicking on the respecting text boxes. Use a "What Is My IP Address" website and if it is showing the IP address of your Hysteria2 server.

> [!CAUTION]
> If no connection could be made with Baidu, Google, and Github doing the latency test, trying having both domain name in **域名**/Domain Name and **地址（支持域名)**/IP Adress(Domain Supported) settings be the same. So instead of using an IP address, use a free subdomain from FreeDNS that will tie to the public IP address of the Hysteria2 server.

> [!Note]
> I haven't test this router setup behind the GFW as I'm setting this up for a friend who will be traveling to China in a few months. Only tested it from my home to a VPS server, both outside of the GFW. I will update this once the router is behind the GFW.
